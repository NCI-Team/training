### Goals
- The trainee will understand what the standard streams are
- The trainee will understand how to redirect the input/output/errors of a program
- The trainee will understand what pipes are and how to use them
- The trainee will learn how to use pipes for automating repetitive tasks

### Tasks
- Read about the standard streams in Linux (STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR)
- What is the file descriptor of each one of the standard streams?
- When redirecting STDIN to a file, how does the program know to read from the file instead of the regular STDIN?
- Explain the following command: `cp ./file1 ./dir1/ >> cp-out.txt 2>&1`
- Read about pipes (Linux pipes) and explain what it is
- Using pipe sort all your history and filter only the commands that starts with 'c'
  - Now using IO Redirection save the output of the filtered history to a file.
- Read about `tee` and `xargs` commands
- Create an ip scanner (ping once every ip address in 192.168.0.0/24 subnet) using the `seq` and `xargs` commands
