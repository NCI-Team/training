### Goals
- The trainee will understand what are VRF, HSRP, Access-Lists and Route Redistribution

### VRF
- Watch [How VRFs Work (VRF Lite)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0IT6ZKY3tg) 
- Watch [Dynamic Routing with VRFs | BGP, OSPF, and EIGRP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RtoNTK-mgE) 
- Watch [Route Target Import and Export | Extending VRF's Across the Core](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW8JjcINgDg)
- In your lab environment, configure on two L3 switches the following topology. Make sure you can access between the interfaces in the same VRF.
  - switch1: 
    - int1- VRF-Yuval,10.0.0.1
    - int2- VRF-Idan,10.0.0.2
  - switch2:
    - int1- VRF-Yuval,10.0.0.2
    - int2- VRF-Idan,10.0.0.1

### HSRP
- Read about HSRP.
- Explain in detail how HSRP works.
- What are the differences between HSRP, VRRP and GLBP?
- Configure HSRP in your lab environment. Make sure it works.

### Access-lists
- Read about [access-lists](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/ios-firewall/23602-confaccesslists.html)
- Explain about the different types of ACLs.
- When should we use standard or extended ACL?
- Configue ACLs in your lab environment. Make sure it works.

### Route Redistribution
- Read about route redistribution.
- Watch [What is Route Redistribution?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDHLnApe6ok)
- Watch [Configuring Basic Redistribution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6edCb05B_l8)
- In what situations should I use route redistribution?
- How it can affect the routing table of the dynamic routing protocol?

### Hands On
- To create the lab vm do the following steps:
  - Download VMware workstation
  - Download EVE-NG 
  - In your terminal go to Downloads directory and run the command: chmod +x [link of the VMware workstation]
  - Unzip the OVA file and import it to VMware workstation. 
  - Download the iol and iou files and insert it to the vm (username:root password:eve) in route /opt/unetlab/addons/iol/bin
  - In your EVE vm run the command: /opt/unetlab/wrappers/unl_wrapper -a fixpermissions
  - Search on the internet "How to set up the UNetLab or EVE-NG network emulator on a Linux system" and follow the "Set up Telnet, VNC, and Wireshark" guide. Do all the steps in your terminal.
