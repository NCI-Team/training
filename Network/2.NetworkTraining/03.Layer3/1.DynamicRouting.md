### Goals
- The trainee will realize how does dynamic routing work
- The trainee will understand when he is required to use each one of the dynamic routing protocols

### OSPF
- Read this document about OSPF: [OSPF.pdf](https://www.routeralley.com/guides/ospf.pdf)
- Watch this lesson about OSPF: [OSPF deep dive](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/protocol-deep-dive-ospf/table-of-contents)
  - After completing this section, you will be familiar with these subjects:
    - OSPF neighbor states
    - All types of link-state advertisement packets
    - ABR and ASBR differences and election process
    - Area types
    - Router's commands for configuring OSPF
    - Router's commands for troubleshooting OSPF

### BGP
- Read this document about BGP: [Border Gateway Protocol | pages 1-13](https://www.routeralley.com/guides/bgp.pdf)
  - What is an administrative distance (AD)? Why does this value useful?
  - What is an autonomous system (AS) number?
  - Explain in detail the different BGP neighbor states.
  - How does the BGP synchronization work?
- Watch [BGP Route Reflectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txrIETLNjhY):
  - What are route reflectors? Why is route reflector required?
- Read about [Route-Maps](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/49111-route-map-bestp.html#backinfo)
  - When should I prefer to use route-maps?
- Read this document about BGP: [Border Gateway Protocol | pages 15-30](https://www.routeralley.com/guides/bgp.pdf)
  - What is MED? Explain in detail.
- Read [How does BGP select the best routing path](https://www.noction.com/blog/bgp-best-path-selection-algorithm)
  - How does the BGP path selection work?
- Read this document about BGP's security: [What Is BGP Hijacking?](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/bgp-hijacking/)
  - How does BGP can be hijacked?
  - What are the dangers of BGP hijacking?
  - Base on the article, what should I do to prevent the BGP hijacking?
