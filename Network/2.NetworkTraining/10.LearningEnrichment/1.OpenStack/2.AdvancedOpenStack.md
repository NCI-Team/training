    1. What is OVS?
    1. What is ML2?
    1. Explain the differences between tenant and provider networks.
    1. Describe 802.1Q.
    1. Describe 802.3ad.
1. Read the [Configuring RBAC policies](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html/networking_guide/sec-rbac) chapter from the Red Hat OpenStack documentation and do the following tasks:
    1. Share a tenant network between two projects.
    1. Share an external network with a project.
1. Complete the course [Red Hat OpenStack Administration III: Networking & Foundations of NFV](https://rol.redhat.com/rol/app/courses/cl310-10.0.5/pages/pr01).
    * You may skip chapters 3 and 8.
1. Learn about low level OpenStack networking, read [Configuring distributed virtual routing](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html/networking_guide/sec-dvr),  [High availability using DVR](https://docs.openstack.org/ocata/networking-guide/deploy-ovs-ha-dvr.html)
and
[Networking in too much detail](https://www.rdoproject.org/networking/networking-in-too-much-detail/)
then answer the following questions:
    1. Explain in detail the difference between centralized and distributed virtual routing (DVR).
    1. Please fill out the following table:
    
        | Routing mode | SNAT IP of an instance with a FIP | SNAT IP of an instance without a FIP | DNAT MAC |
        | ---          |  --- | --- | --- |
        | centralized  |         |          | |
        | distributed  |         |          | |
1. Learn about load balancing [Configure Load Balancing-as-a-Service with the Networking LBaaSv2 API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html/networking_guide/sec-lbaas).
    * Optional - learn about octavia [Load Balancing-as-a-Service (LBaaS) with Octavia](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html/networking_guide/sec-octavia).
1. Learn about [allowed address pairs](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html/networking_guide/sec-allowed-address-pairs), then in your lab environment perfom:
    1. Create a VIP port with keepalived (like the [HAProxy+keepalived exercise](https://gitlab.com/wintrow.vestrit.1/the-hitchikers-guide-to-the-cts/-/blob/master/Exercises/ITTools/Task1.md)), verify the failover between VRRP members.
    1. Attach a FIP to this VIP and verify the failover.
