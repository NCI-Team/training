### PGs:

- What happens when a PG is peering? Is the PG available during that time?

- What is the PG acting set and upset?

- What determines what OSDs will make up a PG?

- Explain, what the following pg states mean:
  - degraded
  - remapped
  - inconsistent

- What is the difference between backfilling and recovery?

- What is the difference between scrubbing and deep scrubbing?

- Why it might be helpful to schedule deep-scrubbing during night times?

- What is the best practice when it comes to OSD per PG ratio?
  - Why more PGs lead to better data distribution in a cluster?
  - What is the cost of having to many PGs?
  - Imagine 2 ceph clusters, one with 40 OSDs and one with 200 deployed on the exact same disks. Both clusters have a single pool,
    the pool has a replicated crush rule, the pool size is 2 and it has 512 PGs. What cluster will recover
    from an OSD failure faster giving there is no network bottleneck?
