### Ceph_Configuration:

- When trying to change a specific daemon's configuration, what is the difference between 
  ceph tell {daemon_type}.{daemon_id} inject args and ceph config set?

- Explain a little about the ceph admin socket. When you would try to change a 
  specific daemon's configuration at runtime, when would you use the ceph config command
  and when would you use the admin socket?

- What is the difference between ceph config show and ceph config get?

- Explain about the centralized configuration database Ceph stores in his monitors.
  Why is this approach better than the deprecated ceph.conf?
