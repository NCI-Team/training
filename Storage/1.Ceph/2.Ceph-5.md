### Ceph-5:
- What is the cephadm tool?

- What tool does cephadm uses to access nodes in the Ceph cluster.

- What is the ceph orchestrator module?

- What is the difference between a daemon, a service and a service type in the Ceph orchestrator? 

- What is the relation between the ceph orchestrator and cephadm?

- In order for a container running a Ceph service to connect to the cluster's monitors
  it uses a minimal ceph.conf containing only the mon_host configuration. This file isn't the
  ceph.conf stored in /etc/ceph/ on the host running the containers. Where is that file located?

  - Notice that this file by default doesn't contain the same content as the /etc/ceph/ceph.conf of the 
    the host, explain why.

  - Remove a mon from the cluster, did the ceph.conf file change?
